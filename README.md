## Project Description (Vision and Scope)
The project made in SOFE 2800U by this group was an item swapping/bartering web application. This readme outlines the prelimary and process actions taken by the team during the development of this website.  The users of this web application can create listings for items they wish to sell/trade away, and view listings of items avaiable for swap created by other users.

Users are able to create an account to make a profile and create listings for an item.  They are able to browse and search other listings and make offers on those listings. Offers can include items and money.  The listing must have picture uploaded by the user, requested offers (items/money or both), and a description of the item.  The listing page will also includes a link to the posting userâ€™s profile.

The web application uses a mySQL database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to provide a visually-focused and easy user experience.  The customer accesses phpMyAdmin to view a comprehensive overview of the website's users, 


### Stakeholders

## How to Run the Web Application

### Database Configuration
Create a file called `php.ini` akin to the following:

```ini
[db_config]
ip = "server ip"
user = "username"
password = "password"
database = "database name"

```

`dbConnection.php` reads the ini file and connects to the database with those credentials
