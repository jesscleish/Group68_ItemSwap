## Overview
This folder contains a collection of conceptual and behavioural models that illustrate the classes and behaviours of the program. There are several diagrams, and three prototypes (two are together in the wireframes pdf) included.

### Contents:
The class diagram shows the different classes within the project, and shows how they interact. It can be found [here](linkhere).

The class diagram, modified slightly, also represents the one of two component diagrams for this project.  The component diagrams can be found [here](linkhere)

- [Main/Navigation component](linkhere) - responsible for controlling a user's interactions and navigation through the website.
- [Login component](linkhere) - allows the user to fully access and utilize the navigation component.

The overall state diagram of the website illustrates the possible flows a user may take through navigating the website. It serves as a map that shows how most pages connect to eachother, and can be found [here](linkhere).

There are several sequence diagrams included within the [Sequence Diagrams folder](linkhere), of both class and system level approaches. These represent how each different component of the website interacts over time/user navigation. The class level sequence diagrams are more in depth, and allows for the analysis of individual class interactions whereas the system level sequence diagrams view the system as whole for it's interactions.

The [Prototypes folder](linkhere) contains a working model of the login/signup page used for the website, as well as two User Interface wireframe designs that were created to convey the possible appearance of the website. These materials were assessed by all stakeholders to ensure they met their needs and requirements as outlined in the [Requirements folder].(linkhere).
