## Overview and Contents
This project utilizes a combination of Data Centered and Layered architecture.
The database for the Item Swap website with tables is quite clearly the repository from which the end users will use their software (web application) to access.  However, it also contains a layered component as the end user's themself and their software also must interract through the database through an interface.  This was done to limit the individual access to the database and help prevent malicious injections.
